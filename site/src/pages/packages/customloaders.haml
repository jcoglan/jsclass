  h2. Custom loader functions

  Some libraries, such as the "Google Ajax APIs":http://code.google.com/apis/ajax/,
  have their own systems for loading code on demand that involve more than
  simply knowing the path to a script file. Our package system allows you to
  specify packages that use a loader function rather than a path to load
  themselves; the function should take a callback and call it when the library
  in question is done loading. For example, here's how you'd incorporate Google
  Maps into your library:

  <pre>JS.Packages(function() { with(this) {
      file('http://www.google.com/jsapi?key=MY_GOOGLE_KEY')
          .provides('google.load');

      loader(function(cb) { google.load('maps', '2.x', {callback: cb}) })
          .provides('GMap2', 'GClientGeocoder')
          .requires('google.load');
  }});</pre>

  The callback (@cb@) is a function generated by the package system that
  continues to load and run dependent code once the custom loader has finished
  its work. If you don't call @cb@ (or pass it to a function that will call it
  for you as above), code that depends on this library will not run.

  @JS.Packages@ also provides post-load setup hooks that let you run some code
  after a file loads. For example, a strategy for loading "YUI3":http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/
  might involve loading the seed file, creating a new global instance of the
  library, then using YUI's own loader functions to load further modules. Some
  sample code:

  <pre>JS.Packages(function() { with(this) {
      file('http://yui.yahooapis.com/3.0.0pr2/build/yui/yui-min.js')
          .setup(function() { window.yui3 = YUI() })
          .provides('YUI', 'yui3');

      loader(function(cb) { yui3.use('node', cb) })
          .provides('yui3.Node')
          .requires('yui3');
  }});</pre>

  Loader functions can also be used to generate library objects that are
  expensive to create without necessarily loading code from external files. Just
  remember to call @cb@ yourself when the generated object is ready:

  <pre>JS.Packages(function() { with(this) {
      loader(function(cb) {
          window.ChocolateFactory = new WonkaVenture();
          // Perform other expensive setup operations
          cb();
      })
      .provides('ChocolateFactory');
  }});</pre>
