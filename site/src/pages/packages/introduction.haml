  h2. Setting up

  Before you can use the @require@ statement, you need the following loaded into
  the page:

  * @JS.Packages@, the dependency manager
  * A list of dependencies

  You can get @JS.Packages@ either by loading the @package.js@ or @loader.js@
  into your environment. (@loader.js@ is @package.js@ plus dependency data for
  JS.Class itself; if you just want to use @JS.Packages@ to manage your code
  without using the rest of the JS.Class library, use @package.js@.)

  After loading the package manager, you need to tell it where to find your code.

  h3. The package manifest

  To describe your packages, you list the external script files used by your
  application, stating which JavaScript objects are provided by the file and
  which objects it depends on. For example, here are a few modules from the
  JS.Class library:

  <pre class="prettyprint">JS.Packages(function() { with(this) {
      file(JSCLASS_PATH + '/core.js')
          .provides('JS.Module',
                    'JS.Class',
                    'JS.Kernel');

      file(JSCLASS_PATH + '/comparable.js')
          .provides('JS.Comparable')
          .requires('JS.Module');

      file(JSCLASS_PATH + '/enumerable.js')
          .provides('JS.Enumerable')
          .requires('JS.Module',
                    'JS.Class');

      file(JSCLASS_PATH + '/hash.js')
          .provides('JS.Hash',
                    'JS.OrderedHash')
          .requires('JS.Class',
                    'JS.Enumerable',
                    'JS.Comparable');
  }});</pre>

  Notice how @Enumerable@ depends on @Class@ and @Module@, which are both
  provided by the same file, @core.js@. Similarly, @Hash@ requires @Enumerable@
  and @Comparable@, which both have a dependency on @Module@. The package manager
  resolves all this and only loads each file once. Object detection is used to
  figure out whether each file has been loaded and a file is not requested
  unless some of its objects appear to be missing.

  Where possible, the package system will attempt to load scripts in parallel
  where it spots that execution order doesn't matter. For example, @Enumerable@
  and @Comparable@ do not depend on each other, so when we want to load @Hash@
  we can load these dependencies in parallel. If the load order of a set of
  scripts is important, you must *make sure you make this clear using the
  @requires()@ statement*. A file will not be loaded until all the objects it
  @requires@ are present.

  A package can also list multiple files. In this case, because JS.Packages
  doesn't know anything about the relationships between the files, it cannot
  automatically parallelize downloads and will just download them sequentially
  when you call @JS.require()@. This is provided as a convenience for loading
  libraries composed of multiple files, where listing their interdependencies
  is more trouble than it's worth and you'd rather specify the load order
  youself.

  For example, to load the "Fancybox":http://fancybox.net/ library, you could do
  this:

  <pre class="prettyprint">JS.Packages(function() { with(this) {
      file( 'fancybox/lib/jquery-1.7.1.min.js',
            'fancybox/source/jquery.fancybox.pack.js',
            'fancybox/source/helpers/jquery.fancybox-buttons.js',
            'fancybox/source/helpers/jquery.fancybox-thumbs.js')
          .provides('jQuery.fancybox');
  }});</pre>

  In addition to @requires()@, there is a statement called @uses()@ that
  specifies a 'soft dependency', i.e. an object the package needs but that does
  not necessarily need to be loaded first. For example, "@Set@":/set.html uses a
  "@Hash@":/hash.html for storage but you could load @Hash@ after the @Set@
  package just fine. On the other hand, @Set@ mixes in "@Enumerable@":/enumerable.html
  and this must be loaded before @Set@ is defined. And, @Hash@ is itself based
  on @Enumerable@. So the package config for this looks like:

  <pre class="prettyprint">JS.Packages(function() { with(this) {
      file(JSCLASS_PATH + '/enumerable.js')
          .provides('JS.Enumerable');

      file(JSCLASS_PATH + '/hash.js')
          .provides('JS.Hash')
          .requires('JS.Enumerable');

      file(JSCLASS_PATH + '/set.js')
          .provides('JS.Set')
          .requires('JS.Enumerable')
          .uses('JS.Hash');
  });</pre>

  The advantage of using @uses()@ is that it helps the package system optimise
  the downloading of packages, since if the load order does not matter the
  packages can be downloaded in parallel.
