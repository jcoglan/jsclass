  h3. @JS.MethodChain@
  
  *Note:* @MethodChain@ is written to be independant of @JS.Class@, so you can use @MethodChain@
  on its own if you like. @JS.Class@ automatically adds all methods from classes you define
  to @MethodChain@'s list of methods.
  
  @MethodChain@ provides a mechanism for storing a sequence of method calls and then executing
  that sequence on any object you like. Here's a quick example:
  
  <pre>
  var chain = new JS.MethodChain();
  
  chain.map(function(s) { return s.toUpperCase() })
      .join(', ').replace(/[aeiou]/ig, '_');
  
  chain.fire(['foo', 'bar'])    // -> "F__, B_R"</pre>
  
  Here, we create a new @MethodChain@ object called @chain@. We then call three methods on it,
  @map()@, @join()@ and @replace()@. @chain@ remembers the names of these methods and the arguments
  you used, then calls the stored chain on any object you pass to its @fire()@ method.
  
  If you call further methods on @chain@, they get added to the list:
  
  <pre>
  chain.split(/_+/);
  
  chain.fire(['foo', 'bar'])    // -> ["F", ", B", "R"]</pre>
  
  h3. How it works
  
  When you call a method like @map()@ on a @MethodChain@ instance, the instance stores the
  name of the method and any arguments you pass to it. All of @chain@'s methods return @chain@
  again, allowing you to chain methods together as shown above.
  
  Any method you want to store in a chain has to exist in @MethodChain@'s list of method names
  in advance (my kingdom for a @method_missing@ feature in JavaScript!), or you will get an
  error. @MethodChain@ comes with over 300 method names in place from the JavaScript core API
  to get you started. If you find that a method is missing, you can add it like so:
  
  <pre>
  // Add all methods from a class or object
  JS.MethodChain.addMethods(jQuery);
  
  // Add methods by name
  JS.MethodChain.addMethods(['methodName1', 'someOtherMethod']);</pre>
  
  All @MethodChain@ instances will then have the methods you've added.
  
  There are a few reserved methods on @MethodChain@ objects that you cannot use for chaining:
  
  * @_()@ - one underscore - more on this in a second
  * @____()@ - four underscores, used for storing method calls
  * @fire()@ - executes the stored chain against its argument
  * @toFunction()@ - returns a function that fires the chain when called
  
  h3. Changing scope using @_()@
  
  All chains have a method called @_()@ (that's one underscore) that you can use to change
  the scope of the chain. By default, each method in the chain is called on the return value
  of the previous method, but @_()@ lets you insert objects into the chain so that subsequent
  methods get called on said object.
  
  @_()@ also lets you insert anonymous functions into the chain. Within each function, @this@
  refers to the return value of the previous method. Putting all this together, you could do:
  
  <pre>
  var chain = new JS.MethodChain();
  
  chain._(document).getElementsByTagName('p')
      ._(function() { console.log(this) });</pre>
  
  When we fire @chain@, the net effect is the same as:
  
  <pre>
  console.log(document.getElementsByTagName('p'));</pre>
  
  If you insert a function into the chain, its return value will be used as the receiving
  object for the next method call in the chain.
  
  h3. @toFunction()@
  
  The @toFunction@ method returns a function that fires the chain against its argument.
  For example, taking the first chain we created at the top of this page:
  
  <pre>
  var func = chain.toFunction();
  func(['foo', 'bar'])    // -> "F__, B_R"</pre>
