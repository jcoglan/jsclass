  h2. Command
  
  @JS.Command@ is an implementation of the "command pattern":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern,
  in which objects are used to represent actions. A command object typically has
  an @execute()@ method that runs its action, and sometimes will have an
  @undo()@ method if it can be reversed.
  
  h3. Creating commands
  
  Here's your basic 'Hello world' command:
  
  <pre class="prettyprint">var helloWorld = new JS.Command({
      execute: function() {
          alert('Hello world!');
      }
  });
  
  helloWorld.execute()
  // -> alerts "Hello world!"</pre>
  
  If your action can be reversed and you want to implement an 'undo' function in
  your code, you need to tell the command how to reverse itself:
  
  <pre class="prettyprint">var incrementCounter = new JS.Command({
      execute: function() {
          someCounter += 1;
      },
      undo: function() {
          someCounter -= 1;
      }
  });
  
  var someCounter = 0;
  incrementCounter.execute();
  incrementCounter.execute();
  incrementCounter.undo();
  
  // someCounter is now == 1</pre>
  
  h3. Creating your own command classes
  
  You'll often want to subclass @JS.Command@ to provide your own types of
  command. For example, you might want to create a type of command that drew a
  circle at random on a @canvas@ element:
  
  <pre class="prettyprint">var DrawCircleCommand = new JS.Class(JS.Command, {
      initialize: function(ctx) {
        
          var x = Math.random() * 400,
              y = Math.random() * 300,
              r = Math.random() * 50;
          
          this.callSuper({
              execute: function() {
                  ctx.fillStyle = 'rgb(255,0,0)';
                  ctx.beginPath();
                  ctx.arc(x, y, r, 0, 2*Math.PI, true);
                  ctx.fill();
              }
          });
      }
  });
  
  var ctx = myCanvas.getContext('2d');
  var randomCircle = new DrawCircleCommand(ctx);
  
  randomCircle.execute();</pre>
  
  Note the general pattern here: we create a subclass of @JS.Command@. This new
  subclass accepts a drawing context to instantiate it (@ctx@), chooses some
  random drawing points, then uses @this.callSuper@ to pass some command
  properties up to the @JS.Command@ @initialize()@ method. Note that the random
  numbers are generated once, rather than every time the command is executed:
  each @new DrawCircleCommand@ does something different, but an individual
  @DrawCircleCommand@ instance ought to do the same thing every time it is
  executed.
  
  *Important:* do not overwrite the @execute()@ or @undo()@ methods in a
  @Command@ sublcass. They contain hooks for talking to command stacks and must
  not be modified. Always use @callSuper()@ as shown above to set up your
  commands. Do not do this:
  
  <pre class="prettyprint">var BrokenCommand = new JS.Class(JS.Command, {
      execute: function() {
          doSomething();
      },
      undo: function() {
          undoSomething();
      }
  });</pre>
  
  This command will not work properly if you try to hook it up to a command
  stack as described below.
  
  h3. @JS.Command.Stack@
  
  If you have actions that can be undone and you want to store the command
  history so you can step back and forth through it later, we have a class
  called @JS.Command.Stack@. To use it, just create one and give it a name:
  
  <pre class="prettyprint">var counterStack = new JS.Command.Stack();</pre>
  
  You can then create commands that will automatically add themselves to this
  stack whenever they are executed, using the @stack@ option:
  
  <pre class="prettyprint">var incrementCounter = new JS.Command({
      execute: function() {
          someCounter += 1;
      },
      undo: function() {
          someCounter -= 1;
      },
      stack: counterStack
  });</pre>
  
  Now, whenever @incrementCounter@ is executed, it gets added to the stack
  @counterStack@. You can use the stack's @undo()@ and @redo()@ methods to step
  back and forth through the command history:
  
  <pre class="prettyprint">var someCounter = 0;
  
  incrementCounter.execute();   // someCounter == 1
  incrementCounter.execute();   // someCounter == 2
  incrementCounter.execute();   // someCounter == 3
  
  counterStack.undo();          // someCounter == 2
  counterStack.redo();          // someCounter == 3
  counterStack.undo();          // someCounter == 2
  counterStack.undo();          // someCounter == 1</pre>
  
  Of course, this is more useful when you have lots of different types of
  commands that can all be undone, and you want to provide a means of stepping
  through the command stack.
  
  Command stacks have a couple of other methods you ough to be aware of:
  
  @stepTo()@ lets you revert to any point in the stack's command history by
  number. @stepTo(0)@ undoes the whole stack, and commands are numbered
  sequentially from @1@ upwards.
  
  @push()@ lets you push a command onto the stack yourself -- this is the method
  @JS.Command@ uses internally if you tell a command to associate itself with
  a stack. When you push a command onto the stack, it is added at whichever
  point in the stack you happen to be, and any previously undone commands after
  this point are discarded. For example:
  
  <pre class="prettyprint">someCounter = 0;
  counterStack.clear();         // 0 commands in stack
  
  incrementCounter.execute();   // 1 command
  incrementCounter.execute();   // 2 commands
  incrementCounter.execute();   // 3 commands
  incrementCounter.execute();   // 4 commands
                                // someCounter == 4
  
  counterStack.stepTo(2);       // still 4 commands in stack
                                // stack pointer is after 2nd command
                                // someCounter == 2
  
  incrementCounter.execute();   // stack truncated
                                // contains 3 commands
                                // pointer at end of stack
                                // someCounter == 3</pre>
  
  h3. Redo from start
  
  Some commands cannot easily be undone, but you'd still like to store them in a
  stack. One example is the circle-drawing command shown above: it's hard to
  'unpaint' a circle because you don't know what filled its space before it was
  there. In some situations it's easier to implement 'undo' by having a stack
  redo itself from the start up to a given point. If you pass a @redo@ command
  when creating a stack, the stack will assume you want a redo-from-start stack
  and will automatically call your @redo@ command to wipe the slate clean before
  running its history again.
  
  As an example, here's a program that allows you to draw random squares on a
  canvas. Hooking this up to a GUI is trivial with this code in place:
  
  <pre class="prettyprint">// Canvas information
  var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas'),
      ctx    = canvas.getContext('2d'),
      W      = 400,
      H      = 300;
  
  // Command for clearing the drawing area
  var clearCanvas = new JS.Command({
      execute: function() {
          ctx.fillStyle = 'rgb(255,255,255)';
          ctx.fillRect(0, 0, W, H);
      }
  });
  
  // A redo-from-start stack
  var drawingStack = new JS.Command.Stack({redo: clearCanvas});
  
  // Command for drawing a random square
  var DrawSquareCommand = new JS.Class(JS.Command, {
      initialize: function(ctx) {
          
          var x = Math.random() * W,
                  y = Math.random() * H,
                  r = Math.random() * 30;
          
          this.callSuper({
              execute: function() {
                  ctx.fillStyle = 'rgb(0,0,255)';
                  ctx.fillRect(x, y, r, r);
              },
              stack: drawingStack
          });
          
          this.name = 'Draw square at ' + x + ', ' + y;
      }
  });</pre>
  
  To undo a step, the drawing stack clears the canvas and then re-runs all its
  commands up to the required step. Notice how the drawing command includes the
  line @stack: drawingStack@ to make sure it is remembered by the stack. To draw
  a square at random, you'd just do this:
  
  <pre class="prettyprint">new DrawSquareCommand(ctx).execute();</pre>
  
  That could easily be hooked up to an interface button, as could a snippet of
  code for calling @drawingStack.undo()@.
  
  The advantage of coding the application like this is that you can add as many
  different types of drawing command as you like without complicating the
  mechanism for undoing them - you just get all your commands to notify a single
  command stack and use that stack to revert changes.
  
  Notice how the command gives itself a @name@ property inside its @initialize()@
  method - this will allow us to represent the command in the GUI in the next
  example.
  
  h3. @length@ and @pointer@
  
  All stacks have a @length@ property that tells you how many commands they
  contain at any point in time. This property only changes when a new command is
  @push()@-ed onto the stack - an @undo()@ or @redo()@ does not change the stack
  length. What does change is the stack's @pointer@ - this number tells you what
  point in the stack the most recently executed command is. For example:
  
  <pre class="prettyprint">var stack = new JS.Command.Stack();
  var command = new JS.Command({
      execute: function() { ... }
  });
  
  // stack.length == 0
  // stack.pointer == 0
  
  stack.push(command);
  stack.push(command);
  stack.push(command);
  
  // stack.length == 3
  // stack.pointer == 3
  
  stack.undo();
  stack.undo();
  
  // stack.length == 3
  // stack.pointer == 1
  
  stack.push(command);
  
  // stack gets truncated
  // stack.length == 2
  // stack.pointer == 2</pre>
  
  h3. They're @Observable@ and @Enumerable@
  
  @JS.Command.Stack@ mixes in the "@Observable@":/observable.html and "@Enumerable@":/enumerable.html
  modules. This means you can implement a Photoshop-style action history with
  barely any code at all by observing the stack:
  
  <pre class="prettyprint"><ul id="drawHistory"></ul>
  
  <script type="text/javascript">
  drawingStack.subscribe(function(stack) {
      var list = document.getElementById('drawHistory'), str = '';
      stack.forEach(function(command, i) {
          var color = (i >= stack.pointer) ? '#999' : '#000';
          str += '<li style="color: ' + color + ';">' + command.name + '</li>';
      });
      list.innerHTML = str;
  });
  </script></pre>
  
  This creates a list that updates itself in response to stack changes. Your
  @subscribe@ callback is passed a reference to the stack whenever the stack
  executes a new command or undoes/redoes a command. Stacks have a @pointer@
  property that tells you what point in the stack the most recent command is. So
  you can work out whether each command has been undone or not, and assign a
  greyed-out color to commands after the current @pointer@ position. Your
  @forEach@ callback is passed each command in the stack in turn, along with its
  position in the stack (beginning at 0).
